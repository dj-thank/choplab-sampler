# Project state

Last prepared: 2026-07-16

## Buildable baseline

The active Gradle project is the MVP under the repository root.

Implemented in the baseline:

- Android 10 / API 29 minimum.
- Audio import through SAF and MediaCodec.
- Microphone recording.
- Android Playback Capture for sources that allow capture.
- Mono PCM internal representation.
- Waveform range selection, zoom, scroll, manual/equal/transient chopping, zero-crossing snap.
- 4 banks × 16 pads.
- Auto-next pad/slice assignment.
- AudioTrack-based low-latency playback.
- Per-pad pitch-by-rate, tone, gain, reverse, one-shot/gate, choke.
- 16-step sequencing, BPM, swing, quantized recording.
- Four-bar mono WAV export.

The offline project validation script passed when this workspace was prepared:

```text
PASS: project-level offline validation completed
```

A complete Android SDK/NDK build was not run in the preparation container. Codex must establish the real Gradle build status on the target machine before claiming the project builds.

## Intended Pro target

The requested target adds:

- Oboe/AAudio native audio engine.
- Project save/load and autosave.
- Undo/Redo.
- Stereo import, playback, processing, and export.
- Pitch-independent time stretch.
- ADSR.
- LFO.
- Pad and master effects.
- USB/Bluetooth/virtual MIDI, velocity, CC learn, clock and transport.
- Multiple patterns and Song mode.
- Master and stem export.

## Reference material

`reference/pro-v0.2/` contains partial source and design documents for the Pro target. It includes:

- `SamplerCore.cpp`
- `NativeBridge.cpp`
- `OfflineRenderer.kt`
- `ProjectArchive.kt`
- `MidiController.kt`
- architecture and feature documents

These artifacts are not wired into the root Gradle project and have missing dependencies. They are design input, not a completed implementation.

## Immediate next milestone

1. Run Gradle sync/build and fix baseline-only issues without adding Pro features.
2. Create `plans/active/choplab-pro-integration.md`.
3. Define a versioned stereo-capable domain model and pure tests.
4. Add NDK/CMake/Oboe infrastructure and a minimal native tone/single-sample proof before replacing the existing engine.
5. Migrate one vertical feature at a time while keeping the application buildable.

## Evidence policy

Update this file only with observed facts. Record exact commands, dates, device/API levels, ABI, and output paths. Separate:

- source implemented;
- host/unit tested;
- Gradle built;
- emulator tested;
- physical-device tested;
- latency measured.

## Workspace preparation checks

See `docs/PREPARATION_VALIDATION.md`. Offline validation and configuration syntax checks passed. Gradle distribution download was blocked by DNS/network restrictions in the preparation container, so Android build success remains to be established on the target machine.
